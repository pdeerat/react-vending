# Vending Machine Exercise

Vending machine created using React and bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Available features

* Keeps a collection of fresh products and plenty of change.
* Can use the coins you insert as part of your change.
* Not satisfied? Open it up and restock to your heart's content!

### Possible future enhancements

* Split back-end and front-end logic to enable connection to a Vending Machine server API.
* Toggle between manual/automatic coin return, in order to be able to keep using remaining balance.
* Increase test suite coverage (currently only covering coin handling scripts, `helpers.js`)
* Fine-tune CSS to make it 100% mobile-beautiful.
